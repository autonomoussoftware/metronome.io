        <p>If you are a resident of the EEA, you have the right to access or modify personal data we hold about you and to ask that your personal data be corrected, erased, or transferred.  The right to transfer your personal data or the right to data portability means that you can request that we provide certain personal data about you that we process in a machine-readable format. The right to erasure means that you can request deletion or removal of certain personal data we process about you.</p>

        <p>You also have the right to know whether, and for what purposes, we process personal data about you, the right to be informed about the personal data we collect and/or process about you, the right to know with whom we have shared personal data about you, for what purposes, and what personal data has been shared (including whether personal data was disclosed to third parties for their own direct marketing purposes), and where processing of personal data about you is based on consent, the right to withdraw your consent to such processing.  You may also have the right to object to, or request that we restrict, certain processing. If you would like to exercise any of these rights, you may contact us as indicated below.</p>
