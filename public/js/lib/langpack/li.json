		"aboutSecurity" : "Lorem...This security encourages the adoption of these blockchains which address Bitcoin’s feature limitations. The transition of transactions from Bitcoin to these more specialized blockchains addresses Bitcoin’s scaling problems, while continuing to drive value back to Bitcoin miners and token holders. As this value is channeled back to Bitcoin, more miners allocate more hashing power to securing Bitcoin and competing for the block reward, further strengthening Bitcoin’s dominance as the world’s greatest utility of immutable proof.",
